# use Terraform modules by covering the following topics:

1.Module basics
2.Module inputs

# Conclusion:-

By defining infrastructure as code in modules, you can apply a variety of software engineering best practices to your infrastructure. You can validate each change to a module through code reviews and automated tests, you can create semantically versioned releases of each module, and you can safely try out different versions of a module in different environments and roll back to previous versions if you hit a problem.
